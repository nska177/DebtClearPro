            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How do I get the best results?</h3>
            <p>Start with accurate numbers. Update your income, expenses, and debts honestly. Try different methods (Snowball, Avalanche, etc.) and see which resonates. Consider adding a small extra payment if possible—those add up over time.</p>

            <h3>How often should I revisit the plan?</h3>
            <p>Every month or two. Life changes: maybe you get a raise, reduce expenses, or want to increase your SIP. Adjust and see how it affects your timeline. Regular check-ins keep you aware and motivated.</p>

            <h3>Why different methods?</h3>
            <p>Each method offers a unique approach. Snowball boosts confidence quickly, Avalanche saves more on interest, Pro-Rata and Equal Distribution feel fair and balanced. Test them and pick what feels right for you. If you get bored or stuck, switch methods.</p>

            <h3>What if I can’t pay extra each month?</h3>
            <p>That’s okay! Even without extra payments, you’re still moving forward. If you ever find spare funds—even small amounts—putting them towards debt accelerates progress. Consistency and patience matter more than big chunks.</p>

            <h3>I cleared one debt. What now?</h3>
            <p>Celebrate! Acknowledge the effort it took. Then focus the freed-up funds on your remaining debts. Over time, you’ll see the momentum build—like going downhill after a long uphill climb.</p>

            <h3>Does this tool save my data?</h3>
            <p>No. Nothing is stored or sent anywhere. Refreshing or closing the page clears everything. This privacy helps you explore freely without worry.</p>

            <h3>Any advice to stay motivated?</h3>
            <p>Set small goals. Appreciate each debt paid off, each rupee of interest saved. Imagine the freedom ahead—a lighter mind and more choices. Reward yourself in small, meaningful ways as you progress.</p>
